QUESTION 3: a dataframe is a collection of similar datasets which is typically used in the organization editing and visualization of data using apprioprates tools
such as data visualizing software or pyhon codes

    panda is a python library that helps read these datasets and assign variables to it so it can be called and used later on. pandas helps in collecting 
and arranging the data and also provides way to edit the data purely through the function

2:
- replacing the values with 'NA'
- mapping missing values with 'O'
-droping or truncating the values


3:
-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on label data. the goal is to learn a mapping between inputs and the corresponding 
 outputs labels so the models can make predictions on new unseen data
 
- logistic regression helps in classifying problems like:
 1 data  preparation
 2 model training
 3 prediction
 4 sogmoid function
4
 confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of classification model.

4b; 
-true positive: this model currently predicts a positive class label
-false positive:
-true negative
-false negative
